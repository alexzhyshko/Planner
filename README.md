##### Planner is a simplistic dashboard service, which provides useful planning features.

  - *Add, join, delete or leave a dashboard*

  - *View your and other user's profile*
  - *Get notified of any event concerning your board*
  - *Set deadline for a task and get notification when it is time*


##### You can also use [this](https://github.com/alexzhyshko/PlannerSpring) API to build your own UI on Android, iOS or any other platform(currently unavailable)


## Tech

##### Planner uses a number of popular technologies to work properly:

* **Java** - widespread programming language mainly used for enterprise projects
* **Spring Boot, Data, Security** - modern and useful open source Java-based framework
* **Hibernate** - enables developers to access persistence data easily
* **Maven** - popular build automation tool
* **MySQL** - open-source relational database management system
* **Angular** - platform for building mobile and desktop web applications
* **Bootstrap 4** - free front-end framework for faster and easier web development
* **Swagger UI** - instrument for easy and fast REST documenting

##### Milestones for future development:
* **Log4J** - implement Log4J logging for easy problem tracking and solving
* **Android** - apart from having web version, I plan implementing the same idea using Android platform
* **Desktop** - in addition, it would be great to have a desktop PC(Windows) version of such app

### And of course Planner is open source with public repositories on GitHub.
